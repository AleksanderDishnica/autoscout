Welcome to AutoScout.
This repository is a car web application.
It will allow you to have three types of users: Guest, Registered user and Admin.
As a guest you can place cars in the cart.
Registered users can use the buy button.
Admin can add, remove or make the cars visible or popular.

Please if you find any bugs, let me know and I will fix them.

How to install the project
